		<description>I am now the proud owner of the octaviomaury.com domain, no silly .github.io shit. I'm surprised how cheap I  got it for, actually, it was  only 8$/year. SO from now on, just go to octaviomaury.com for all your octo-related  needs.

 Thats about it.

 Cheers.

		<description>  The Movie Portal is up. Actually, its been done since last night but I was too tired to write a blog post about it.  I'm gonna be postin animations and stuff as well as whatever I feel like lol. Last night I put up this video where  I run a C script. It's pretty cool.

 In other news, I got a job at a burger place, so hopefully I can start buying cool things like skating gear or a  new computer.

 Thats about it.

		Cheers.

 I made a brand-new page on the site. Check it out!
 https://octaviomaury.github.io/blogposts.html

 Very early on in the redesigning of my site, I realized that after a while, the Blog Posts would probably take up  a lot of space on the homepage, and that would probably be a pain in the ass for anyone with slow internet.

 So, making an archive for blog posts has been on my mind for a while now. Turns out it was extraordinarily  easy to do.

 Pretty much everything about making a website is deceptively easy to do.

 So, from now on only 3 blog posts will be shown on the homepage, and if you wanna read older posts, just go  through The Archives

 Another cool thing this new archive allows for is easier sharing, as each post now has it's own url.

 Errrrm that's about it.

 Cheers.
