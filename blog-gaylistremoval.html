					&nbsp; lmao im not even gonna attempt to sugarcoat this, but I got fired from my burger place job,
					and my it might've &nbsp;been because of the gaylist on here being so "not PC". so as an attempt to not
					scare away any future &nbsp;employers, I've unlisted it from any navigation panels. Of course, I wouldn't
					ever remove it <b>completely</b> as I<br>&nbsp;still think it's funny and im doing this kind of reluctantly. 
					You can still view the gaylist &nbsp;if you follow <br> &nbsp;<a href="https://octaviomaury.com/gaylist.html">this hyperlink</a> 
					or if you have it bookmarked, &nbsp;or if you look at the html files on 
					<a href=https://github.com/OctavioMaury/octaviomaury.github.io>my Github</a>. I'm hoping to maybe<br> &nbsp;at 
					some point in &nbsp;the future bring it back, but for now, its gonna remain unlisted. I'm gonna keep updating it.<br>
					&nbsp;Don't worry :)

					&nbsp; In other news, school let out for summer break, so now I can start workin on the website more than I
					could've<br>  &nbsp;with homework breathing down my neck (kidding. I never actually did the homework. STICK IT TO DA MAN!)
					<br><br>
					&nbsp;Yesterday, the first day after school let out, I had a power outage for about 7 or 8 hours, and spent most of the <br>
					&nbsp;day in the backyard with my family. at some point it got dark and we were going to bed, and after we had fallen<br> &nbsp;asleep,  
					&nbsp;at exactly 1AM, the power came back, and every light in the house turned on simultaneously. It was<br> &nbsp;pretty funny.
					<br><br>
				&nbsp;Thats about it.
				<br><br>
            &nbsp;Cheers.
